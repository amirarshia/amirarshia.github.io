	<h2>Sea turtles live/environment</h2>
	<p style="border-radius:30px;border:5px solid rgb(72, 255, 0); padding:15px; display: inline-block;">
		<br> Sea turtles are amazing creatures. They come in different colors, and sizes;
		<br> these gentle giants can weights up to 2,000 LBS 900 kilograms, (unit of
		<br> mass in the metric system),and when they are hatched from their egg,
		<br> they can be as small as the palm of your hand. They also mostly travel
		<br> in warmer parts of the oceans like in the Indian ocean and the Pacific
		<br> ocean. Sea turtles have also been on earth for more than 100 million
		<br> years, that also means they shared the earth with dinosaurs at one point.

	<h2>Nesting</h2>
	<p style="border-radius:30px;border:5px solid rgb(72, 255, 0); padding:15px; display: inline-block;">
		<br>When it is time for the sea turtles to reproduce, the female sea turtles take
		<br>a trip to the shoreline to lay their eggs. Females(a girl) come out of sea to
		<br>nest eggs while the male(a boy) turtles stay in the sea. Sea turtles dig with
		<br>their back flippers, nest their eggs, and cover them again. And also, they
		<br>mostly come back to the same beach. They lay 110 eggs each time!!

	<h2>survival</h2>
	<p style="border-radius:30px;border:5px solid rgb(72, 255, 0); padding:5px; display: inline-block;">
		Sea turtles protect themselves in many ways. They don’t get in danger that
		<br>often but if they do, they have very strong flippers, so they can have
		<br>a fast runaway. And also, they have a sleek body that protects them.
		<br>They don’t have teeth but, their jaws have modified (make partial or
		<br>minor changes to something) “beaks” to help them eat their usual diet
		<br>which could be anything from seaweed to jelly fish. they search for
		<br>food all day, Sea turtles are like pigs, they eat a lot of food!

	</p>

	<h2>did you know!?</h2>
	<p style="border-radius:30px;border:5px solid rgb(72, 255, 0); padding:15px; display: inline-block;">
		<br>-If the sand is cold when the turtle is hatching it
		<br>becomes a male and if the sand is hot
		<br>it will be a female.
		<br>-Sea turtles can’t react into their shells:(
		<br>-Sea turtles have a excellent sense of direction!
