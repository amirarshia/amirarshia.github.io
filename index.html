		Sea turtles come in different colors, and sizes; these gentle
		<br> giants can weights up to 2,000 LBS (900 kilograms, unit of mass in the metric system)
		<br> but when they are hatched they can be as small as the palm of your hand,
		<br> orâ€¦. you get what I mean. Right, let's get back to
		<br> learning; sea turtles also mostly travel in warm oceans and probably not
		<br> around antarctica. Oh yah, sea turtles have also been on earth for more than
		<br> 100 million years, and that means they shared the world with dinosaurs!
